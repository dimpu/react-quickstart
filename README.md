# React Quickstart
React quick start with TypeScript and Browserify


A simple quick start project to create react components using TypeScript. 
We are using Browserify as a build tool to convert our typescript and tsx code into ES5 javascript.

# How to use?

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dimpu/react-quickstart.git
```

## to run

```shell
npm start
```
Hot reload enabled using `budo` server.


## to build
```shell
npm run build
```
This command will create two file in your dist folder
1) vendor.js
2) app.js


## Thank your

That's is we are done. Let me know if you found any bug.
Cheers!!!
